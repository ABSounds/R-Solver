# R-Solver

A Python tools for deriving R-Type adaptors for
[Wave Digital Filters](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/WaveDigitalFilters).

This code is not quite production-ready. If you are
interested in contributing, please contact me through
this repository.

## How It Works

In order to use this script, you must have the
[Sage](https://www.sagemath.org/) software system
installed. From there, you can run the `r_solver.py`
script to generate a scattering matrix for a given
netlist. For more options, use `r_solver.py --help`.
